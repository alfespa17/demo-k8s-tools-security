# Kubernete Security Scanning Demo [![gitpod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod&style=flat-square)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/alfespa17/demo-k8s-tools-security)

This repository contains a gitpod workspace with the following tools that can be used to do static code analysis for kubernetes

- [kube-linter](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter)
- [kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform)
- [kube-score](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score)
- [chekov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov)
- [snyk](https://github.com/snyk/cli)

Two additional tools to scan kubernetes configuration that will require a real cluster to test.

- [kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench)
- [kube-hunter](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter)
- [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
